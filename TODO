TODO

- Provide an option to dump a single patch from a bank.  E.g. "-p 2"
  This will turn on -l.
  - Option is in processArgs() and "patch" but it is not yet used.
    Need to update Format() to honor it.
- Handle multiple files.
- Handle file format variations.  Look around to see what variations
  there are and decide whether we care.  As an example, we could run 
  through a file looking for F0 before processing.
- Write a reverse dump program so we can edit the dump and send it back.
- CSV option to dump a huge set of files in a spreadsheet-friendly way:
    filename, patch #, patch name
- Search feature to search for a string in names in a large number of files.
  Will print the filename, patch number, and patch name for each name
  found.  Case-insensitive search.
